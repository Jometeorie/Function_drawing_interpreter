STYLE is dark
origin is (0, 35)
SCALE is ( 40,40)
color is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
for t from 0 to 2*pi step 0.01 draw (sin(t), cos(t))
color is (0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
for t from 0 to 2*pi step 0.01 draw (-2.2+sin(t), cos(t))
color is (0.9, 0.5, 0.1)
for t from 0 to 2*pi step 0.01 draw (2.2+sin(t), cos(t))
color is (0.4, 0.1, 0.6)
for t from 0 to 2*pi step 0.01 draw (-1.1+sin(t), -1.1+cos(t))
color is (0.6, 0.9, 0.4)
for t from 0 to 2*pi step 0.01 draw (1.1+sin(t), -1.1+cos(t))
